# Database Query Repository

Welcome to the Database Query Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of queries and examples related to various databases that I have utilized throughout my experience. The covered databases include:

### `MongoDB`: A NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability.

### `MySQL`: A powerful relational database management system widely used for structured data.

### `DynamoDB`: A fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), offering seamless scalability.

### `Redis`: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
